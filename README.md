# React-TypeScript-Webpack boilerplate

## Get started
Being a boilerplate, the easiest way is to clone/fork and get started with your job. 

```
git clone https://github.com/AnkitKSinha/react-ts-webpack-boilerplate.git
```

In case you'd want to know the basics, you might want to go through the documentations for [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

Besides these, you might also want to go through the various webpack plugins, webpack-dev-server and other loaders for processing files. 

## Development
